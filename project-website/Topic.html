    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The integration of Artificial Intelligence in education promises efficiency and innovation, but it also poses significant challenges that must not be overlooked.</p>

    <h2>Key Issues</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Academic Integrity:</strong> AI tools such as ChatGPT can be misused by students to complete assignments dishonestly.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> AI systems often collect and process sensitive student information, raising concerns about security and consent.</li>
      <li><strong>Bias and Fairness:</strong> Algorithms may reflect societal biases, affecting assessments and recommendations for students unfairly.</li>
      <li><strong>Teacher Displacement:</strong> Over-reliance on AI could undermine the role of human educators, leading to reduced job opportunities and mentorship quality.</li>
    </ul>
